Smart Switchboard System

A smart switchboard system designed to optimize energy usage, manage devices based on schedules, detect human presence using a webcam, and send daily electricity usage reports via email. This project combines IoT, AI, and energy management in a smart home system.

Features
- Device Management: Automatically turns devices ON/OFF based on schedules and usage patterns.
- Human Detection: Uses a webcam to detect human presence. If no person is detected, the system turns off lights and unnecessary devices.
- Energy Optimization: Optimizes energy usage by turning off unused devices and limiting the load when the total power usage is too high.
- Email Reports: Sends daily email reports with electricity usage and estimated costs.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas

Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-switchboard.git
    cd smart-switchboard

2. Install the required dependencies:

    You can install the required libraries using pip:

    pip install opencv-python numpy pandas

3. Update Email Settings:

    In the code, thereâ€™s an email report functionality. Please update the send_email_report() function with your email credentials:

    sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
    receiver_email = "recipient_email@gmail.com"
    password = "your_password"

    Note: You may need to enable "Less secure apps" in your Gmail account for the email sending functionality to work, or use an App Password if 2-step verification is enabled.

How to Run
1. Run the program:

    In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the project, and run the script:

    python smart_switchboard.py

    The program will start and continuously monitor device usage, human presence, and send daily email reports at 8 PM.

2. Expected Output:

    - It will print a dashboard showing device status (ON/OFF), power consumption, and recent usage logs.
    - If no human is detected, it will turn off the lights.
    - The system will send a daily email report at 8 PM with electricity usage and estimated cost.

Configuration
You can modify the following parameters to suit your needs:

1. Device Schedules:
   - Modify the schedules for each device in the user_preferences dictionary:

     user_preferences = {
         "hvac": {"schedule": [(8, 22)]},  # HVAC ON from 8 AM to 10 PM
         "lights": {"schedule": [(18, 23)]},  # Lights ON from 6 PM to 11 PM
     }

2. Device Power Consumption:
   - Adjust the power consumption for each device in the devices dictionary:

     devices = {
         "lights": {"power": 60, "state": False},
         "hvac": {"power": 1500, "state": False},
         "oven": {"power": 2000, "state": False},
         "refrigerator": {"power": 200, "state": True},  # Always ON
     }

3. Email Report Settings:
   - Modify the send_email_report function to match your email settings for sending daily reports.

Example Output
The system will print periodic information to the console, such as:

    ðŸ”¹ Starting Smart Switchboard System...
    ðŸ‘¤ Human detected! Keeping devices ON.
    --- Smart Home Energy Dashboard ---
    Current Time: 2025-02-23 20:05:00
      lights: OFF (60W)
      hvac: ON (1500W)
      oven: OFF (2000W)
      refrigerator: ON (200W)
    Total Energy Usage: 1700 W
    Recent Usage History:
      2025-02-23 19:59:00: lights OFF
      2025-02-23 19:59:00: hvac ON
      ...
    ---------------------------------

At 8 PM, the program will send an email like:

    Subject: Daily Electricity Usage Report

    Hello,

    Your daily electricity usage report:
    - Total Power Consumption: 1700 W
    - Estimated Cost: â‚¹8.5

    Best,
    Smart Switchboard AI
